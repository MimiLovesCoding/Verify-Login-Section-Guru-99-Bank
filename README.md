Solution: The new test scenario expanded from one positive to include three negative test cases.
          In an order to reduce test time in a 3 week sprint, the @Test annotation with the priority
          attribute was used giving test a numerical value during test execution. Next, @paramenters was 
          added to allow the execution of all testing scenarios on multiple browsers to include Chrome, 
          Firefox and Safari. Validations were used to verify the accuracy of the pass or failure of each test
          scenario. Upon the completion of all test cases an index.html report was generated for further 
          test verification 3 positive tests passed and all other negative test failed as specified by client.

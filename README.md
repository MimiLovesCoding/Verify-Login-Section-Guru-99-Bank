Solution: The new test scenario expanded from one positive to include three negative test cases.
          In an order to reduce test time in a 3 week sprint, the @Test annotation with the priority
          attribute was used giving test a numerical value during test execution. Next, @paramenters was 
          added to allow the execution of all testing scenarios on multiple browsers to include Chrome, 
          Firefox and Safari.

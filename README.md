üí° Solution: The test scenario was expanded from a single positive case to include three additional negative test cases, enhancing the 
   coverage and robustness of the testing process. To optimize test execution during the three-week sprint, the @Test annotation with the 
   priority attribute was utilized, assigning numerical priorities to the test cases for efficient sequencing. Additionally, the 
   @Parameters annotation was implemented, enabling the execution of all test scenarios across multiple browsers, including Chrome, 
   Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari, to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

   Validations were systematically applied to confirm the accuracy of each test case's pass or fail status. Upon completion, an index.html
report was generated, providing a comprehensive summary for further test verification. The results showed that all 
   four positive test cases passed, while the negative test cases failed as per client specifications, validating the expected behavior.
